# Phi_S_Diag_Persistent
 
In this code we present the implementaiton of the Phi_S diagram, according to the report presented in this article: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.21.477230v1 
The essential concept of this method is to define the existence of causal pathways that could led to the definition of robust models in systems biology. To this end, the patterns in time series are anaysed using persistent homology, which is a robust method against noise to extract topological features from data. 

In this investigation we analysed the cardiac response to excersise in patients wearing sensors; this data has been downloaded from the following repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/MHEALTH+Dataset
